# PCA-LDA-Scratch-Implementation-in-Python
A scratch implementation of Principal Component Analysis(PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) in Python.

In both of these notebooks, I will be using the well-known Iris-Dataset for the sake of simplicity and easy verification.

If there are any issues feel free to contact me and let me know!
